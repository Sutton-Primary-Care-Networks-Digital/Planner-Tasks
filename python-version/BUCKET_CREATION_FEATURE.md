# 🔨 Bucket Creation Feature

## ✨ **What's New**

The Microsoft Planner Task Creator now includes an **automatic bucket creation feature** that eliminates the hassle of manually creating buckets before importing tasks.

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Step 1: Automatic Detection**
When you upload a CSV with bucket names that don't exist in your selected planner, the tool will:
- 🔍 Identify all missing bucket names
- 📊 Show how many tasks will use each missing bucket
- 📋 Provide a clear summary of what needs to be created

### **Step 2: User Control**
You get full control over the bucket creation process:
- ✅ **Master Toggle**: Enable or disable bucket creation entirely
- 📝 **Individual Selection**: Check/uncheck each bucket you want to create
- 🎯 **Convenience Buttons**: "Select All" and "Clear All" for quick selections
- 📈 **Task Count Display**: See exactly how many tasks will use each bucket

### **Step 3: Smart Creation**
Once you've selected your buckets:
- 🔨 Click "Create Selected Buckets" to create them in real-time
- ⚡ Uses Microsoft Graph API for instant bucket creation
- 📊 Shows progress and results for each bucket
- 🔄 Automatically updates bucket mappings after creation
- ✨ Refreshes the interface to show newly created buckets

## 🏗️ **Interface Design**

```
🔧 Create Missing Buckets
Found 3 bucket name(s) that don't exist in the planner.

✅ Enable bucket creation

📝 Bucket Creation Options:
✅ Create    🗂️ Marketing       2 task(s)
✅ Create    🗂️ DevOps          1 task(s)
❌ Create    🗂️ Training        1 task(s)
---

[✅ Select All] [❌ Clear All]

🎯 Ready to create 2 bucket(s):
- 🗂️ Marketing (2 task(s))
- 🗂️ DevOps (1 task(s))

[🔨 Create Selected Buckets]
```

## 🛡️ **Error Handling**

The feature includes robust error handling:
- **Permission Issues**: Clear error messages if you don't have bucket creation rights
- **API Failures**: Graceful handling of network or API errors
- **Partial Success**: Reports which buckets were created successfully
- **Fallback**: Tasks with failed bucket creation go to the default bucket

## 🎨 **Visual Feedback**

Enhanced visual indicators throughout:
- ✅ **Green checkmarks**: Existing buckets that match
- 🆕 **"NEW" badges**: Newly created buckets
- ❌ **Red X's**: Buckets that will use the default
- 📊 **Task counters**: Show impact of each bucket

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

- Uses Microsoft Graph API `POST /planner/buckets`
- Requires write permissions to the planner
- Creates buckets with proper `orderHint` for sorting
- Updates bucket mappings in real-time
- Refreshes cached data automatically

## 📋 **Test Scenario**

The updated `test_tasks.csv` includes several bucket names that likely don't exist in your planner:
- **Marketing** - for marketing-related tasks
- **DevOps** - for deployment and infrastructure tasks  
- **Training** - for training and documentation tasks

This lets you test the bucket creation feature immediately!

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **🕙 Time Saving**: No need to manually create buckets in Planner first
2. **🎯 Selective Control**: Create only the buckets you actually need
3. **📊 Informed Decisions**: See task counts before creating buckets
4. **🔄 Seamless Integration**: Works perfectly with existing workflow
5. **🛡️ Safe Operation**: Easy to review before creation, with clear fallbacks

This feature transforms the tool from a task importer to a **complete planner setup solution**!
